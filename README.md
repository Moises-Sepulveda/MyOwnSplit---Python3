# MyOwnSplit---Python3
Hello! This is my first application in Python for GitHub. This is about a lab that I found in PCAP 2 course in Edube.org, with some modifications.  With this program, you can insert a separator character and a sentence that you want separate (convert in list), the program function is similar to function split(), the difference is that was make by me.
